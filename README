A collection of things I have written, was planning to write,
or am writing now. Usually, these had their own git repos,
somewhere on the web, or were scattered around my various old
websites. This is their new home.

Most of the old ones will probably never be born. Some of the
ideas contained within will be put into other, newer things,
and all this will possibly continue ad infinitum. Such is the
nature of art, I guess.

Work contained here is written by me, Felix Saparelli, and is
licensed to you mostly freely. Generally, this is manifested by
a Creative Commons license. If nothing is precised, assume it
is released in the Public Domain.
