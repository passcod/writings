The aChronicles of Phi
======================

...is a set of loosely related stories written by FÃ©lix Saparelli
with a recuring underground organisation called "The Messengers
of Phi". This organisation is not particularly tied to most of the
novels, but makes an appearance here and there, oftimes not really
advancing the plot at all.

It is left as an exercise to the (avid) reader to piece together
what the organisation really is, and who (or what) is Phi. The
full text of all novels related to Phi is and will always be available
here, for free. It is currently under a [Creative Commons BY-NC-ND][1]
license (unless otherwise specified), so you may read it without fear
of nasty fines or pernicious lawsuits.

Some are short stories, some are longer ones. Generally, have a look at
their URLs: the ones on their own subdomains are longer, chaptered ones, while
the ones here are shorter, all on one page. Some stories may not be available
yet. Maybe I'm too busy writing them to put them up, maybe I haven't written
enough. Just be patient; they'll get there.
