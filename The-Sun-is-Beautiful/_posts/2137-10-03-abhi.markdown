Hey sis,

I've fixed a few typos here and there, but only in comments! Your spelling
hasn't improved, huh? I really miss having a real wire, this email-proxy
solution is weird. It's kinda cool to be able to work on something so normal
right now, I keeps the pressure off.

Anyway, here's the diff:

I've also changed the copyright line: it's your baby now. Take good care of it,
OK? ;)

Keep me posted,

Abhi
